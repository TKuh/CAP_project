Speed:

* reduce number of calls to `StructuralCopy`

Features:

* list expressions for logic templates
* do not inline variables but only a reference to them for the logic to use
* support compilation of operations
* For categories with finitely many objects (or morphisms): detect parts of the code which can be precomputed, e.g. hom_structure_on_basis_paths in Algebroids.
* unify deduplication and hoisting: hoisting in duplicate code can lead to different variable names, so the deduplication does not match anymore (partially fixed)
