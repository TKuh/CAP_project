Speed:

* reduce number of calls to `StructuralCopy`
* get value of all expression from jit args only once
* logic templates per category?
* drop unused variables completely (instead of marking them with _UNUSED_)

Features:

* list expressions for logic templates
* do not inline variables but only a reference to them for the logic to use
* support compilation of operations
* support assigning a variable multiple times, at least in different if branches
