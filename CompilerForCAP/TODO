Speed:

* reduce number of calls to `StructuralCopy`
* get value of all expression from jit args only once
* logic templates per category?
* drop unused variables completely (instead of marking them with _UNUSED_)

Features:

* list expressions for logic templates
* do not inline variables but only a reference to them for the logic to use
* support for KeyDependentOperation
* support compilation of operations
* support assigning a variable multiple times, at least in different if branches
* handle WithGiven derivations explicitely (Note: The WithGiven derivations use CallFuncList with the second argument
  being of type EXPR_ELMS_LIST. We do not want to handle this in the resolving phase due to performance concerns.)
