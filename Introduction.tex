\CapPkg is an acronym for categories, algorithms, and programming.
It is a software project implemented in \GAP.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \CapPkg derives powerful algorithms and data structures from basic categorical constructions.
  \item \CapPkg serves as a categorical programming language in which you can realize your
  code in a categorically structured way.
  \item \CapPkg simplifies complex computations
  by applying theorems.
 \end{itemize}
We call this concept \textbf{categorical programming}. 
This manual provides a short tutorial for \CapPkg and explains
its main features.
